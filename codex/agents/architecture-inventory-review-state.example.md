    title: "Prompt management is missing from the component inventory."
    status: "open"
    problem: "The inventory omits the shared prompt registry/loader/builder boundary."
    evidence:
      code:
        - "src/prompts/registry.py owns prompt registration."
        - "src/prompts/loader.py loads prompt versions."
      docs:
        - "AGENTS.md lists prompt management as a high-signal entrypoint."
    why_it_blocks: "Architecture docs would miss a shared cross-runtime dependency."
    required_fix: "Add a prompt-management component with its discovered primary paths."
```
