name: architecture-documentation-workflow
description: Run a repository-local state-driven architecture documentation workflow through `.codex/agents/architecture-documentation-state.md`. Use when the user asks to discover repository architecture components, create or continue architecture docs, document components, review generated architecture docs, or continue architecture documentation from state.

# Architecture Documentation Workflow

Use this skill to discover repository architectural components, create one reviewed architecture document per component, and advance through the component inventory with fresh agents.

Durable files:
- `.codex/agents/architecture-documentation-state.md` - component inventory, current component, doc progress, and drift metadata.
- `.codex/agents/architecture-inventory-review-state.md` - current-cycle inventory review ledger.
- `.codex/agents/architecture-doc-review-state.md` - current-cycle component doc review ledger.

## Workflow

1. Read `.codex/agents/architecture-documentation-state.md`.
2. If missing, initialize from `.codex/agents/architecture-documentation-state.example.md`.
3. Route by state:
   - `DISCOVERY_READY`: call `architecture-component-discoverer`.
   - `INVENTORY_REVIEW_READY`: reset `.codex/agents/architecture-inventory-review-state.md` to clean `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, then call a fresh `architecture-component-inventory-reviewer`.
   - `COMPONENT_READY`: choose the first component with `status: pending_doc`, set `current_component`, then call `architecture-doc-writer`.
   - `DOC_REVIEW_READY`: reset `.codex/agents/architecture-doc-review-state.md` for `mode: component_doc`, then call a fresh `architecture-doc-reviewer`.
4. If inventory review state becomes `COMPLETE`, continue to `COMPONENT_READY`.
5. If doc review state becomes `REVIEW_BLOCKED`, call `architecture-doc-fixer`.
6. After fixer resets doc review state to clean `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, call a fresh `architecture-doc-reviewer`.
7. When doc review state becomes `COMPLETE`, mark the current component `status: doc_complete`, clear `current_component`, set state `COMPONENT_READY`, and continue to the next `pending_doc` component.
8. If no pending components remain, set state `ALL_COMPLETE` and stop.
9. Stop only on `ALL_COMPLETE`, `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`, or `MAX_ROUNDS_REACHED`.

## Fresh Agent Rule

- Spawn a fresh inventory reviewer for each inventory review pass.
- Spawn a fresh doc reviewer for each component doc review pass.
- Do not paste prior reviewer or fixer reports between agents.
- State files are authoritative.
- Before a reviewer runs, ensure `active_findings: []` and no archived findings or fix attempts are present.
- The fixer may read active findings, but must clear them before the next reviewer.

## Component Doc Scope

Each `architecture-doc-writer` run writes exactly one component doc. Docs should be high-level architecture documentation, not implementation guides.

Expected sections:
- Purpose
- Responsibility Boundary
- Wired Entrypoints
- Main Collaborators
- State / Data Flow
- Runtime Flow
- Security / Isolation Notes
- Operational Notes
- Known Gaps Or Drift

Use Mermaid diagrams when they clarify component flow or boundaries.

## Hard Rules

- Code is the source of truth; verify claims through wired paths from `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not modify application code in this workflow.
- Do not let reviewers edit docs.
- Do not let fixers broaden beyond active findings.
- Keep architecture docs under `docs/architecture/`.
- Keep one writer run scoped to one component only.

## Final Response

When the workflow stops, report:
- final architecture documentation state status,
- current component if any,
- completed docs,
- blocked findings or clarification needs if present,
- whether all known components are documented.
