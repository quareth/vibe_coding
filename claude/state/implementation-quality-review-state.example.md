# implementation-quality-review-state.example.md

Template for `.claude/state/implementation-quality-review-state.md`. The live state file is ignored by Git. Copy the clean state, set one branch or commit target, and let the first reviewer freeze the exact Git diff.

## Clean state

```yaml
schema_version: 2

## Frozen branch scope

For `kind: branch`, resolve and persist:

```yaml
scope:
  kind: "branch"
  target_ref: "feature/my-branch"
  base_ref: "origin/main"
  locked: true
  resolved:
    target_sha: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
    base_sha: "1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
    merge_base_sha: "2222222222222222222222222222222222222222"
    diff_range: "2222222222222222222222222222222222222222..0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
    worktree_head_sha: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
    resolved_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    changed_files:
      - status: "M"
        path: "src/services/example_service.py"
        old_path: ""
      - status: "R100"
        path: "apps/web/src/new_name.ts"
        old_path: "apps/web/src/old_name.ts"
```

This scope means all implementation changes between the branch merge base and the frozen branch-head SHA. Later commits on the branch are outside the current run.

## Frozen commit scope

For `kind: commit`, `target_ref` may be a full or abbreviated commit id. Resolve the exact commit and its first parent:

```yaml
scope:
  kind: "commit"
  target_ref: "0123456"
  base_ref: ""
  locked: true
  resolved:
    target_sha: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
    base_sha: "3333333333333333333333333333333333333333"
    merge_base_sha: ""
    diff_range: "3333333333333333333333333333333333333333..0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
    worktree_head_sha: "4444444444444444444444444444444444444444"
    resolved_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    changed_files:
      - status: "A"
        path: "src/runtime/example.py"
        old_path: ""
```

This scope means only implementation introduced by that commit. For merge commits, use the first parent. For a root commit, use Git's empty tree as `base_sha`.

## Blocked state

```yaml
status: REVIEW_BLOCKED
round: 1
active_findings:
  - id: "Q1-P1"
    round: 1
    priority: "P1"
    severity: "blocker"
    category: "duplication_single_authority"
    title: "The scoped implementation introduced a second runtime identity resolver."
    status: "open"
    location:
      file: "src/services/example_service.py"
      symbol: "resolve_runtime_identity"
      lines: "40-72"
    scope_evidence:
      target_sha: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
      changed_file: "src/services/example_service.py"
      diff_hunk: "The frozen diff adds resolve_runtime_identity at lines 40-72."
    problem: "The scoped helper duplicates the established resolver and can drift from its placement rules."
    evidence:
      - "The frozen diff introduces the duplicate helper."
      - "src/runtime/registry.py:20 is the read-only contextual authority."
    maintenance_risk: "Two authorities must be updated together."
    violated_rule: "CLAUDE.md — DRY and runtime-provider boundary."
    estimated_fix_scope: "small"
    required_fix: "Remove the scoped duplicate and delegate to the established resolver without editing that resolver."
    behavior_preservation: "Preserve provider selection, serialized identity, public contracts, and runtime results."
    verification:
      - "Run the focused runtime-provider service tests."
```

## Status routing

- `READY_FOR_REVIEW`: spawn a fresh quality reviewer.
- `REVIEW_BLOCKED`: call the quality fixer.
- `COMPLETE`: stop and continue the parent workflow.

The loop has no clarification or manual-stop status. Every candidate must resolve as behavior-neutral scoped cleanup, a non-blocking large-refactor suggestion, or no finding.

## Rules

1. Resolve and freeze the Git scope once; never recalculate it or replace its refs during the same run. Reset state before selecting another branch or commit.
2. `active_findings` contains only small/medium quality cleanup proven to originate in the frozen diff.
3. The fixer may edit only non-deleted `scope.resolved.changed_files` paths and may not create implementation files.
4. Surrounding code is read-only context and cannot become cleanup scope.
5. Pre-existing unrelated dirt, dead code, and duplication stay out of scope.
6. Behavior, public contracts, implementation intent, and runtime results must not change.
7. Clear active findings before every fresh review; keep no finding or fix history.
8. Keep only refactor suggestion paths as durable non-blocking outputs.
