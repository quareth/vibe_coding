name: implementation-guide-review-loop
description: Run a state-driven review/fix loop for implementation-guide documents only (not code), using `.claude/state/implementation-guide-state.md` and `.claude/state/implementation-guide-review-state.md`. Use when the user asks to review an implementation guide, run blocker-only guide review, or loop reviewer/fixer until guide blockers are resolved.

# Implementation Guide Review Loop

Use this skill for implementation-guide document quality loops, not code implementation loops.

Durable files:
- `.claude/state/implementation-guide-state.md` - guide path and review scope.
- `.claude/state/implementation-guide-review-state.md` - current-cycle blocker ledger.

## New-Chat Simulation Rule

Each cycle must simulate:

```text
new chat -> guide review -> blocker findings -> guide fix -> new chat -> guide review
```

Rules:
- Spawn a fresh `implementation-guide-reviewer` every review cycle.
- Do not pass prior reviewer/fixer chat content to the next reviewer.
- Fixer must reset review-state to clean `READY_FOR_REVIEW` after applying guide fixes.

## Modes

1. `full_guide`:
- Review the entire guide from guide-state.

2. `section`:
- Review only the section selected in guide-state.

3. `current_phase`:
- Review only the current implementation phase selected in guide-state.
- Use `phase` from `.claude/state/implementation-guide-state.md`.
- Verify the phase against the full guide, related design, and current repo reality where needed for contradiction checks.

## Loop behavior

1. Read `.claude/state/implementation-guide-state.md`.
2. Initialize/reset `.claude/state/implementation-guide-review-state.md` with clean `active_findings: []`.
3. Call fresh `implementation-guide-reviewer`.
4. If state -> `REVIEW_BLOCKED`, call `implementation-guide-fixer`.
5. Fixer edits the guide and resets state to `READY_FOR_REVIEW`.
6. Call a new `implementation-guide-reviewer`.
7. Repeat until:
   - `COMPLETE`, or
   - `MAX_ROUNDS_REACHED` (hard cap 20), or
   - `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`.

## Hard rules

- Blocker-only findings; ignore enhancements.
- Fixer edits guide docs only (plus guide-review-state reset).
- Do not modify application code in this loop.
- Keep guide structure stable unless blocker resolution requires structural change.

## Refactor Guide Overlay

When state or the guide identifies behavior-preserving refactor work:

- Review against repository refactor policy and state-listed safety rules as binding authority.
- Block guides that omit P0 baseline/snapshot before extraction.
- Block guides that omit structural extract/prove/migrate/remove sequencing.
- Block guides that allow fallback paths, compatibility shims, re-exports, aliases, or new flags.
- Block guides that do not end with Review & Cleanup/P0 comparison acceptance criteria proving no dead code, no duplicate definitions, all callers migrated, and locked baseline tests rerun.
